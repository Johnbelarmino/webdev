# Web Development side projects

Some simple projects written in HTML, CSS and Javascript during my winter break. Some of these projects are complete and others
while others are not complete. Enjoy :)

# 1-4-19 : Boomin'
 A landing page I created inspired from the app named Boomin' I created during the summer of 2018. Designed in Adobe Photoshop and then translated into HTML and designed in CSS.
